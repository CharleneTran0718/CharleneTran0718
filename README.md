<h1 align="center">Welcome to my page!!! My name is Charlene 👩🏻‍💻</h1>

As a recent graduate 🎓 with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, I have built a solid foundation in software engineering through hands-on experience with both front-end and back-end technologies. I’ve gained proficiency in languages such as Python, Java, C#, JavaScript, and SQL, and have experience working with NoSQL databases like MongoDB and Supabase.

In my development journey, I’ve mastered React, React Native, and Next.js for building responsive, user-centric applications. On the back-end, I’ve worked with Python, Java, and C to design and optimize APIs and improve database performance. Additionally, I am experienced in using cloud platforms like Azure and AWS to deploy and scale applications, and version control systems like Git and GitHub to collaborate and manage code efficiently.

Beyond coding, I’ve used tools like Jira, SharePoint, and TeamDynamix for project management and documentation, and I am well-versed in systems management with Active Directory and VMware. Driven by a passion for problem-solving and continuous learning, I aim to combine my skills in both front-end and back-end development to contribute to impactful software engineering projects.
